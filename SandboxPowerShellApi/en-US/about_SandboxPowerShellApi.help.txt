SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The Sandbox Powershell Module includes an object manager PS drive provider to inspect and
	manipulate the object manager namespace.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Under the hood of the Win32 API is the NT Object Manager which acts similar to a filesystem.
	This is normally hidden from view and requires specialist tools such as WinObj to inspect it.
	This Sandbox Powershell API comes with a PS drive provider which allows you to enumerate entries
	and modify certain properties in the name space.

	By default a new drive will be created, Objects: which can be used to access the namespace. It's
	also possible to add other drives with different roots if needed. Accessing the namespace works 
	just like other PS driver providers. You can use Get-ChildItems to enumerate items Get-Item to
	get an individual object.
